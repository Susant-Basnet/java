Default Method in Interface:--
        
             Default method was introduced in Java 8.Default interface 
            methods are an efficient way to deal with this issue. They 
            allow us to add new methods to an interface that are 
             automatically available in the implementations. Thus,
             there's no need to modify the implementing classes.

        Example:
              public interface MyInterface {
     
            // regular interface methods
     
            default void defaultMethod() {
            // default method implementation
           }
        }
