Q) Why multiple inheritance is not supported in java?
          To reduce the complexity and simplify the language, multiple 
          inheritance is not supported in java.
          Consider a case where A, B, and C are three classes. The C
         class inherits A and B classes. If A and B classes have the same 
         method and you call it from child class object, there will be 
         ambiguity to call the method of A or B class.
