    Exception class:
             
              Exception  is a problem that occurs during the execution of a program.
              When an Exception occurs the normal flow of the program is disrupted 
              and the program ends abnormally, which is expected, therefore, these
             exceptions should be handled.


           class MyException extends Exception
{
	public MyException(string s)
	{
		//Call constructor of parent exception
		super(s);
	}
}
 public class VirtualMachineError{
 	//Driver program
 	public static void main(String[] args)
 	{
 		try
 		{
 			//throw an object of user defined exception
 			throw new MyException("Aashish Bhandari");
 		}
 		catch (MyException e)
 		{
 			System.out.println("Caught");

 			System.out.println(e.getMessage());
 		}
 	}
